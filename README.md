# React API Integration Task

## Overview

This is a live coding task designed to evaluate a candidate's ability to work with React and external APIs. The task involves fetching and displaying data from a public API.

## Task Description

### Requirements

1. Create a React application that fetches data from a public API endpoint (the endpoint will be provided separately)

2. Display the data in a clean, organized manner:
   - Show the title and body for each post
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Handle potential errors gracefully

### Technical Requirements

- Use React (Create React App or Vite)
- Implement proper error handling
- Use modern React practices (hooks, functional components)
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Include basic styling (CSS/SCSS)

### Bonus Points

- Implement TypeScript
- Add unit tests
- Include error boundaries
- Add loading skeletons
- Implement responsive design

## Evaluation Criteria

The candidate will be evaluated on:

- Code organization and structure
- Error handling
- React best practices
- Code readability
- UI/UX considerations
- Performance considerations

## Time Limit

- 1 hour live coding session

## Submission

- The solution will be evaluated during the live coding session
- Be prepared to explain your approach and any assumptions made
- Be ready to discuss potential improvements or additional features you would implement given more time

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

## Available Scripts
